## Connection Details

### Button Matrix
Each button connects between a row and column pin. A diode is placed in series with each button to prevent "ghosting" (false button presses).
- Row pins are set as outputs (LOW for scanning, HIGH otherwise)
- Column pins are set as inputs with pull-up resistors
- Diodes are oriented with cathode toward the row pin

### Rotary Encoders
- Connect CLK and DT pins to GPIO pins
- Connect SW (push button) pin to GPIO pin
- Connect common pin to GND
- Use 10kΩ pull-up resistors on CLK, DT, and SW pins

### RJXT1F 7-way Encoder (Funky Switch)
- Connect each direction pin to a GPIO pin
- Connect common pin to GND
- Use 10kΩ pull-up resistors on all pins

### Power Supply
- USB-C connector provides 5V
- 3.3V regulator (if needed) to power the ESP32
- Decoupling capacitors (0.1μF) near the ESP32 power pins

### Programming Interface
- Reset button connects between ESP32 EN pin and GND
- Boot button connects between ESP32 GPIO0 and GND
- Status LEDs connect to available GPIO pins through appropriate resistors
