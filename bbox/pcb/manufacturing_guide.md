# PCB Manufacturing Guide for ESP32 Button Box with RGB LEDs

This guide provides instructions for preparing the PCB design files for manufacturing with services like PCBway, including special considerations for the RGB LED integration.

## Recommended PCB Design Software

We recommend using [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) (free and open-source) for implementing this PCB design. Other options include:
- Altium Designer
- Eagle
- EasyEDA
- Fusion 360 Electronics

## Design Implementation Steps

1. Create a new project in your PCB design software
2. Set up the schematic based on the `schematic_description.txt` file
3. Assign appropriate footprints to all components as listed in the BOM
4. Generate the netlist from the schematic
5. Create a new PCB layout and import the netlist
6. Place components according to the guidelines in `pcb_layout_description.txt`
7. Route the traces following the routing guidelines
8. Add mounting holes, silkscreen labels, and other features
9. Perform design rule checks (DRC) to ensure manufacturability
10. Generate Gerber files for manufacturing

## Generating Gerber Files

Most PCB manufacturers require Gerber files in the RS-274X format. Here's how to generate them in KiCad:

1. From the PCB Editor, click on "File" > "Plot"
2. Select the following layers:
   - F.Cu (Top copper)
   - B.Cu (Bottom copper)
   - F.Paste (Top paste)
   - B.Paste (Bottom paste)
   - F.SilkS (Top silkscreen)
   - B.SilkS (Bottom silkscreen)
   - F.Mask (Top solder mask)
   - B.Mask (Bottom solder mask)
   - Edge.Cuts (Board outline)
3. Set the output directory to a new folder (e.g., "gerber")
4. Check "Use Protel filename extensions"
5. Click "Plot" to generate the Gerber files
6. Click on "Generate Drill Files" to create the drill files
7. In the drill file dialog, select "Excellon" format and click "Generate Drill File"

## Design Rules for Manufacturing

Ensure your design meets these minimum specifications for reliable manufacturing:

- Minimum trace width: 0.2mm (8 mil)
- Minimum spacing: 0.2mm (8 mil)
- Minimum drill size: 0.3mm (12 mil)
- Minimum annular ring: 0.15mm (6 mil)
- Minimum text size: 0.8mm (32 mil)
- Power traces for RGB LEDs: 1.0mm (40 mil) minimum

## Submitting to PCB Manufacturer

1. Compress all Gerber files and drill files into a ZIP archive
2. Upload the ZIP file to your chosen PCB manufacturer's website
3. Specify the following parameters:
   - Board dimensions: 150mm x 100mm (or as adjusted)
   - Material: FR-4
   - Thickness: 1.6mm
   - Copper weight: 1oz
   - Number of layers: 2
   - Surface finish: HASL or ENIG
   - Solder mask color: Green (or preferred color)
   - Silkscreen color: White (or preferred color)
4. Review the design preview provided by the manufacturer
5. Confirm and place the order

## RGB LED Integration Considerations

When implementing the PCB design with WS2812B RGB LEDs, pay special attention to the following:

1. **Power Distribution**:
   - The WS2812B LEDs can draw up to 60mA each at full brightness (white)
   - With 20 LEDs, the total current could reach 1.2A at maximum brightness
   - Use wide traces (1.0mm minimum) for the 5V power distribution to the LEDs
   - Consider using power planes or wide copper pours for the 5V and GND connections

2. **Signal Integrity**:
   - The WS2812B LEDs require precise timing for the data signal
   - Keep the data lines as short as possible
   - Include a 100Î© resistor in series with the data line near the first LED
   - Use a level shifter (74HCT245) to convert the 3.3V signal from the ESP32 to 5V for the LEDs

3. **Thermal Considerations**:
   - Provide adequate spacing between LEDs to allow for heat dissipation
   - Add thermal vias under or near the LEDs to help dissipate heat to the ground plane
   - Consider the thermal impact when all LEDs are illuminated at full brightness

4. **Layout Recommendations**:
   - Place the LEDs directly under the transparent button caps
   - Ensure consistent spacing and alignment for uniform lighting
   - Consider adding a small reflector or diffuser for each LED to improve light distribution

## Additional Recommendations

- Request a DFM (Design for Manufacturing) check from the manufacturer
- Consider ordering a small quantity first to verify the design
- Include a README file with your Gerber submission explaining any special requirements
- If possible, include a PDF or image of the expected PCB layout for reference
- Test the RGB LED circuit with a prototype before finalizing the design
- Consider adding test points for the LED data line and power connections

## Common Issues to Avoid

- Copper too close to board edges (keep at least 0.5mm clearance)
- Silkscreen overlapping pads
- Missing or incorrect drill files
- Incorrect layer assignment
- Insufficient clearance around mounting holes
- Inadequate power traces for the RGB LEDs
- Missing level shifter for the LED data signal
- Insufficient decoupling capacitors for power stability
- Improper grounding that could cause noise in the LED signal
