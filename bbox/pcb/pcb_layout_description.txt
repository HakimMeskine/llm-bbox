# ESP32 Button Box - PCB Layout Description

## Board Specifications
- Dimensions: 150mm x 100mm (adjust as needed based on final component placement)
- Layers: 2 (Top and Bottom)
- Material: FR-4
- Thickness: 1.6mm
- Copper weight: 1oz
- Surface finish: HASL (Hot Air Solder Leveling) or ENIG (Electroless Nickel Immersion Gold)
- Solder mask: Green (or preferred color)
- Silkscreen: White (or preferred color)

## Component Placement

### ESP32-WROOM-32 Module
- Placed centrally on the top side of the PCB
- Ensure adequate clearance around the module for the antenna
- Keep the antenna area free of copper pour and other components

### Button Matrix (5x4 = 20 buttons) with RGB LEDs
- Arranged in a 5x4 grid on the top side
- Spacing: 20mm between button centers (adjust as needed)
- Diodes placed close to each button to minimize trace length
- WS2812B RGB LED placed underneath each button
- Use transparent or translucent keycaps to allow light to shine through
- Ensure adequate spacing for LED heat dissipation

### Rotary Encoders
- Placed on the top side, one on each side of the button matrix
- Ensure adequate spacing for knobs

### RJXT1F 7-way Encoder (Funky Switch)
- Placed on the top side, preferably at a convenient location for thumb operation
- Ensure adequate clearance for operation

### Power and Programming
- USB-C connector placed at the edge of the PCB
- Voltage regulator and associated components placed close to the USB-C connector
- Reset and Boot buttons placed at accessible locations
- Status LEDs placed where they are visible during operation
- Level shifter (74HCT245) placed close to the ESP32 and the first RGB LED
- Power filtering capacitors (100μF, 10μF) placed close to the power input for RGB LEDs

## Routing Guidelines

### General
- Minimum trace width: 0.25mm for signal traces
- Minimum trace width: 0.5mm for power traces (1.0mm for RGB LED power)
- Minimum clearance: 0.2mm between traces
- Use ground plane on both layers
- Keep traces as short as possible, especially for the button matrix

### Critical Traces
- Keep USB data lines (D+ and D-) as short as possible and of equal length
- Route clock signals (for encoders) with minimal length and away from noisy signals
- Keep power traces wide and direct
- RGB LED data lines should be kept as short as possible
- Ensure the RGB LED data line has a 100Ω series resistor at the beginning of the chain

### Vias
- Minimum via size: 0.6mm drill, 1.2mm pad
- Use vias to connect ground planes between layers
- Avoid vias in pads unless necessary

## Special Considerations
- Add mounting holes at the corners of the PCB
- Include a ground pour on both layers, connected with vias
- Add test points for critical signals
- Include version number and date on the silkscreen
- Add polarity indicators for components where applicable
- Consider adding a cutout or slot for cable management if needed
- Ensure adequate power distribution for RGB LEDs (they can draw significant current when all lit)
- Add thermal relief for RGB LED connections to help with soldering and heat dissipation
- Consider adding a separate power plane for the 5V supply to the RGB LEDs

## Pin Correction
Note: There was a pin conflict in the schematic. GPIO4 was assigned to both Rotary Encoder 1's CLK and the Funky Switch's Up-Right direction. The corrected assignment is:
- Rotary Encoder 1 CLK (A): GPIO4 (unchanged)
- Funky Switch Up-Right: GPIO39 (changed from GPIO4)
